@W: MT529 :"c:\users\shiwa\desktop\t2mi_pps_project\src\sync_modules.v":36:0:36:5|Found inferred clock t2mi_pps_top|clk_100mhz which controls 494 sequential elements including reset_sync_inst.reset_sync_reg[2:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
